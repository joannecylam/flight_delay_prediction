# Flight Delay Prediction

## Preprocessing:
1. Categorical variables are converted to binary variables.
2. A subset (40%) of the training data (named "flight_delay_data_subset.csv") is used in model testing and hyperparameter tunning.
3. Constant variable "Departure" is dropped to reduce training cost.


## Approach 1: Random Forest
## Approach 2: Xgboost
## Approach 3: MLP Regressor
